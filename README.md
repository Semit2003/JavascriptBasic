NFT Collection

This project demonstrates how to create, store, and list NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) using JavaScript. Each NFT is represented by an object containing metadata such as name, artist, year created, and description. The NFTs are stored in an array and can be listed and counted.

Project Structure

nfts: An array to hold the NFT objects.
mintNFT(name, artist, yearCreated, description): A function to create and store an NFT.
listNFTs(): A function to list all NFTs by printing their metadata to the console.
getTotalSupply(): A function to return the total number of NFTs minted.
Functions

Parameters:

name: The name of the NFT.
artist: The artist who created the NFT.

This function iterates through the nfts array and prints the metadata of each NFT to the console.
